1.
Normalized (Optimizes for minimizing redundancy, not for read time)
-- such db contains many tables like id + sth, uses joins etc.
vs
Denormalized Databases (Optimizes for read time, not for minimizing redundancy)
-- such db contains as many columns in one table as possible (not need to create more tables...),
not clear solution but faster

2.
-- Data integrity --
Entity Integrity: No duplicate rows exist in a table.
Domain Integrity: Restricting the type of values that one can insert in order to enforce correct values.
For example, using enums.
Referential Integrity: Records that are used by other records cannot be deleted (using constraints)
